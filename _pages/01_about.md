<p style="text-align: center;">--<i>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</i>--</p>

I am a scientist by nature and by training, and I have extensive experience in data analysis and coding. Most recently, I became a volunteer firefighter on the island where I live.

My background is in biology, but some of the things I am currently learning about include:
* Firefighting
* Physics
* And -- of course -- more coding
