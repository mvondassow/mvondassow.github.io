I am a scientist by nature and by training, with a background in biology. I currently work as a freelance coder and data analyst, and I recently became a volunteer firefighter on the island where I live. I am also interested in physics, astronomy, and pie.

Coding: I am especially fond of programming in Python; however, I have recently been working a lot with Javascript/Google Apps Script and Ruby/Rails. I have used Matlab and other software suites extensively for data analyses in the past.

Data analysis: I have used non-parametric methods, parametric methods (especially ANOVA), and bootstrap approaches for various types of analyses. I also enjoy image processing and analysis.

Science & education: For short descriptions of my previous and ongoing research projects please see [this page](/research). I received a B.S. in biology from the University of Washington and a Ph.D. in integrative biology from the University of California, Berkeley. I then did a postdoc in the University of Pittsburgh's Bioengineering Department and taught biology courses at various universities and community colleges. I am currently affiliated with the [Ronin Institute](http://ronininstitute.org/).
