Options:
1) One of the simple but non-easy to find stats methods (CI on quantiles, or ESD test).

2) Game that compares stats strategies
--Goal: Try to get best match to 'true' model with minimum cost
--Initial: Start with coins to spend; model: p out of q variables have effect with randomly chosen magnitude (player does not know p or effect sizes), costs randomly assigned.
--Each experiment cost x to start, y per each individual after, z for stats
--Player chooses variable, chooses n and whether to look at stats or just eyeball it.
--Player adjusts model as desired.
--Runs sim: if matches less well than null model, loses points, if matches better gains points.
--Competes against computer strategies: 1: n of 10, does stats; n of 2, no stats; n of 100 only adjusts model if p<0.01.

3) Start building rescue game.

4) Image processing (get sources of images).
