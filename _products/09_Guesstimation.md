How can you tell potential customers enough about likely costs that they'll know whether they should inquire further? 

My wife and I are building a house, and I've lost count of how many businesses I stopped considering because it was too much trouble to get a ballpark estimate. I wasn't looking for a specific number; I just wanted a range, even a large one, to start with. Many businesses are unwilling to provide that information even if you spend a long time on the phone with them (or worse, fill out a form and wait a long time for them to contact you). And I've lost countless hours talking to people about which options might match our budget. This isn't just a problem for home builders and excavators; it's also the case for Web designers, software developers, and other businesses that do custom work.

Before getting a precise estimate, your potential customers need to know if your service is likely to fall within their budget; otherwise, they may walk away before finding out that your service could work for them. And, of course, it will save everyone time if they know approximately what the likely costs are before they speak with you. 

Here's a graphical approach (for a hypothetical trucking company) that gives the customer an idea of whether a service might be within their budget, without pinning the service provider to specific numbers:
