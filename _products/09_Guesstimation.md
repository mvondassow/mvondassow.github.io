How can you effectively tell potential customers enough about what your product might cost that they'll know whether it's worth inquiring further? 

My wife and I have been working on building a house, and I've lost count of how many times I've skipped past businesses where I couldn't find a price on their website and how many hours I've spent talking to people to try to determine whether one or another option is worth considering. Web designers, software developers, and others seem to be -- if anything -- worse than excavaters and home builders when it comes to providing their potential customers basic information needed to proceed further.

Here's a graphical approach (for a hypothetical trucking company) that gives the customer an idea of whether your product might be within their budget, without pinning you to specific numbers:
