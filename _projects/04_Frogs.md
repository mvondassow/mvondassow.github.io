Coming fresh from a biomechanics lab into a bioengineering lab, I started my postdoctoral work confident that the precise mechanical properties of embryos would be crucial to normal development. Embryonic shape changes and tissue movements (morphogenesis) is the process that makes us more than dull blobs. However, there was little data to show that morphogenesis is actually sensitive to variation in tissue stiffness; if anything, what data there was seemed to indicate that embryo stiffness was highly variable. 

Subsequent measurements of embryo-to-embryo variation in frog (*Xenopus laevis*) embryos suggested that they can tolerate two-fold or more variation in tissue stiffness. Even more exciting to me was the realization that their response to environmental variation (specifically temperature) puts constraints on the physics of morphogenesis. If you warm them a bit they go through grossly similar movements but much faster (see video above from <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095670">von Dassow et al, 2014</a>). Are the cells pushing harder or getting softer? My experiments suggested they do neither: I could not detect effects of temperature on in their mechanical properties or the forces they generated. A simple model suggests that the way the tissues combine solid-like and fluid-like properies might explain why the developmental movements change subtley at different temperatures while the rate of deformation changes dramatically.
