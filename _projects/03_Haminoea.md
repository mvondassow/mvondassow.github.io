My wife discovered that the embryos of her favorite\* snail\*\* can survive brutal conditions that they frequently experience when stranded on sun baked mudflats at low tide. I decided I wanted to study this too, so I horned in on her project. We have been examining how much water they can lose and still develop (lots) and the extent to which the goop that surrounds the embryos protects them from drying.

Some handy pieces of code developed in this project include functions to run certain statistical tests and code to track blobs in a series of images.

\* However, she claims to love all snails equally.
