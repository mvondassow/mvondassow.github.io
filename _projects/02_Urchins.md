This project examines how mechanical interactions among cellular and non cellular parts of an embryo influence the embryo's response to the environment. It focuses on sea urchin embryos because they are amenable to both experimental and mathematical analysis: at early stages they're spherical balls with one layer of cells surrounding an interior space, and they are directly exposed to the environment. Salinity variation in particular should cause mechanical effects as cells swell and shrink due by osmosis.

The transformation of a ball of cells into a complex organism involves phyiscal forces that move and deform cellular and non-cellular parts of the embryo. Cells can both generate forces to move themselves and deform the embryo and detect the forces acting on them; the can also detect other mechanical features of their environment (e.g. the stiffness of the matrix they attach to). Environmental factors can influence every step of this process. This suggests that physical processes could mediate environmental effects on development
